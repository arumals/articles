Compact and portable speakers may be preferable if you plan to carry them around or have limited space. Additionally, pay attention to the build quality and materials used in the speaker's construction to ensure durability and longevity.

### Additional features such as water resistance, voice assistants, etc.

Bluetooth speakers often come with a range of additional features that can enhance their functionality and convenience. For example, if you anticipate using the speakers outdoors or in wet environments, look for models that offer water resistance or waterproofing.
